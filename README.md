 ```

## Plan

- [x] Have a repo of Infosec icons.
- [ ] Add more icons.
- [ ] Nice folder structure.
- [ ] Actually make fonts/SVGs out of them...

## Contributing

Feel free to raise a pull request and add to this collection. There are a lot of infosec tools out there which I will have undoubtedly missed, or couldn't find the logo or the tool/project didn't have a logo.
